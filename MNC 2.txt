succeeded in getting the maximum number of placements for this academic year.
The departments that have participated in the recruitment drive are CSE,ECE,
MECH. Help the college find the department getting maximum placements. Check
for all the possible output given in the sample snapshot
Note : If any input is negative, the output should be “Input is Invalid”. If all
department has equal number of placements, the output should be “None of the
department has got the highest placement”.
Sample Input 1:
Enter the no of students placed in CSE:90

Enter the no of students placed in MECH:70
Sample Output 1:
Highest placement
CSE
Sample Input 2:
Enter the no of students placed in CSE:55
Enter the no of students placed in ECE:85
Enter the no of students placed in MECH:85
Sample Output 2:
Highest placement
ECE
MECH
Sample Input 3:
Enter the no of students placed in CSE:0
Enter the no of students placed in ECE:0
Enter the no of students placed in MECH:0
Sample Output 3:

None of the department has got the highest placement

Vohra went to a movie with his friends in a Wave theatre and during break time he
bought pizzas, puffs and cool drinks. Consider the following prices :
Rs.100/pizza
Rs.20/puffs
Rs.10/cooldrink
Generate a bill for What Vohra has bought.
Sample Input 1:
Enter the no of pizzas bought:10
Enter the no of puffs bought:12
Enter the no of cool drinks bought:5
Sample Output 1:
Bill Details
No of pizzas:10
No of puffs:12
No of cooldrinks:5
Total price=1290
ENJOY THE SHOW!!!

Problem Statement – Write a program to calculate the fuel consumption of your
truck.The program should ask the user to enter the quantity of diesel to fill up the
tank and the distance covered till the tank goes dry.Calculate the fuel consumption
and display it in the format (liters per 100 kilometers).
Convert the same result to the U.S. style of miles per gallon and display the result. If
the quantity or distance is zero or negative display ” is an Invalid Input”.
[Note: The US approach of fuel consumption calculation (distance / fuel) is the
inverse of the European approach (fuel / distance ). Also note that 1 kilometer is
0.6214 miles, and 1 liter is 0.2642 gallons.]
The result should be with two decimal place.To get two decimal place refer the
below-mentioned print statement :

float cost=670.23;
System.out.printf(“You need a sum of Rs.%.2f to cover the trip”,cost);
Sample Input 1:
Enter the no of liters to fill the tank
20
Enter the distance covered
150
Sample Output 1:
Liters/100KM
13.33
Miles/gallons
17.64
Explanation:
For 150 KM fuel consumption is 20 liters,
Then for 100 KM fuel consumption would be (20/150)*100=13.33,
Distance is given in KM, we have to convert it to miles (150*0.6214)=93.21,
Fuel consumption is given in liters, we have to convert it to gallons
(20*0.2642)=5.284,
Then find (miles/gallons)=(93.21/5.284)=17.64
Sample Input 2:
Enter the no of liters to fill the tank
-5
Sample Output 2:
-5 is an Invalid Input
Sample Input 3:
Enter the no of liters to fill the tank
25
Enter the distance covered
-21
